# jDex
A Pokedex written in Java.\
This program utilizes [fanzeyi](https://github.com/fazeyi) basic dataset of all Pokemon. Which is data compiled from [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page).\
This can be found here: [pokemon.json](https://github.com/fanzeyi/pokemon.json)

Currently work in progress, need to work on the GUI aspect of the program.
