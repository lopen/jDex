# jDex
A Pokedex written in Java.\
This program utilizes [fanzeyi](https://github.com/fazeyi) basic dataset of all Pokemon. Which is data compiled from [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page).\
This can be found here: [pokemon.json](https://github.com/fanzeyi/pokemon.json)

Things that need doing: 
- GUI
- Underlying functionality of the actual Pokedex
- All of the good stuff
